# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Domain-modeling skills create them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This repository uses a single-context layout:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether it reflects the project's language or note a genuine gap for domain modeling.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface the conflict explicitly instead of silently overriding it.
